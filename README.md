# LaneDev

Clone the repo and run the following commands

```
(1) npm install
(2) node app.js
``` 


P.S. to check if the middleware is working all you have to do is run the url 
```localhost:3000/my_weather```

The route will use the KOA.JS Middleware. You can pass the ip address(optional) and have to pass the weather appid(required). 
The API we are using is http://openweathermap.org/api.

The test cases can be implemneted using 'jest' framework by facebook which works very well with KOA
